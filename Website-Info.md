Tasks: Marketing, Partnerships, Community Growth,  
My Experience:  
At Sippycup, I found a new love for trading in markets. Starting with stocks and quickly learning how to navigate the atmosphere. I began pursuing my knowledge in crypto during this time, later becoming the go to source of information for thousands. Learning the foundations of marketing and community management, I grew this community to 3000+ members of organic traders.

Time: Jul 2018 \- Sep 2022  
Tasks: Teach high quality educational content in web3, build a community, scale network effect.  
My Experience: SmileBack was my first venture into the world of Founder. I created my own educational trading community where we amassed 3000+ members with hundreds active daily.

### Beacon: 

Role: Advisor  
Time: Oct 2017 \- Aug 2020  
Tasks: Strategic ideation   
My Experience: Beacon was one of my earliest Advisor experiences, It was here I learned the fundamentals of launching, maintaining, and scaling a blockchain project. We focused on building a novel masternode community coin. We were acquired by “DECENOMY”.

### Atomic Bazaar:

Role: Community Manager  
Time: Oct 2017 \- Jul 2018  
Tasks: Create fun and engaging experience for community members.   
My Experience: Dan and Jomessin from AB are some incredibly talented people. This was an underrated project through and through. The community didn’t grow very large but we had a lot of fun learning what people reacted to best. This company was very quickly acquired by OpenSea for some of the smart contract services we offered (first mutli-erc20 TX in single sends).

### Block Duelers:

Role: Advisor  
Time: Dec 2018 \- Dec 2020  
Tasks: Creative Ideation  
My Experience: Block Duelers was ahead of it’s time all in all. We were building an NFT based trading card game with various fighting characters and betting mechanics. Launching this during the bear market was a rookie mistake, lesson learned.

### Fyre Network:

Role: Advisor  
Time: Dec 2020 \- Feb 2021  
Tasks: Tokenomics and Strategic merger planning  
My Experience: This was a mess, but still something to learn from. We went into this project with 5 separate Masternode coin projects looking to merge into a single massive community. Each with varying tokenomics and community size. It was a nightmare to run the numbers determining a fair distribution and adequate go-to-market strategies. It was a fighting chance to salvage a lot of lost effort that in the end shut down quickly.

### 0n1 Force:

Role: Advisor  
Time: Apr 2022 \- Present  
Tasks: Strategic Ideation, AI solutions, Community solutions, Web3 Solutions  
My Experience: 0n1 Force has been one of the most fun communities to be a part of. With $250mil+ in sales since inception, the project has generated massive interest from hundreds of thousands of people. This continues to shape up to be one of the most impressive anime/gaming web3 communities out there.

###  GM Labs:

Role: Founder  
Time: Aug 2022 \- Present  
Tasks: AI and NFT scaling solutions, stressing like a CEO  
My Experience: During the early days of AI advancement, I saw an opportunity to create something special. This project holds a lot of sentimental value to me. Using many different layers of AI, my team and I began crafting a dynamically unique storytelling experience that was reactionary based lore from one of the largest NFT community projects out (10ktf). We published weekly lore updates, nearly daily community events continuing the story and depth of the experience. This project has fallen to the backburner a bit as the markets unfolded and some internal team issues began to arise. Mark my words, these creatures will roam the tunnels again.

### Impressum Trading:

Role: CEO  
Time: Sep 2022 \- Jul 2024  
Tasks: Educator, Founder, Dev  
My Experience: Impressum Trading was my first officially launched company, I focused on using my extensive web3 educational background to create an easy to follow and engaging learning experience. Having spent more than 20,000 hours studying projects, markets, and charts as a whole. I leveraged this to provide a deep level of insight into nearly all market actions. We also offered web3 services such as NFT and erc20 contract creation and launching. As well as some art focused services building NFT collections.

### Delta Trading Group:

Role: Crypto Educator  
Time: Apr 2021 \- Sep 2022  
Tasks: Educator, Course Curator  
My Experience: This was one of the most stressful experiences I’ve had in this space to date. Having hundreds of students under my wing of “Crypto Education” in this company, I curated and taught 3 classes per week often lasting 2 hours each. Curating each class to simplified terms among some of the most complicated technology aspect in the industry. After hundreds of recorded classes we were able to create an incredibly thorough educational course for students to follow in short form content.

### InnerCircle Alpha:

Role: CEO  
Time: Jan 2023 \- Sep 2023  
Tasks: Crypto Educator, Alpha curator  
My Experience: This was a really fun chance to showcase how thorough my research into various projects can get. I created a private/invite-only NFT alpha group focused on research each project being spotlighted in excruciating detail, and proceeding to have hosted discussions about these projects. This group was incredibly successful as traders, having many traders earn well over 100x gains in their time.

### LemonSocial (NSFW):

Role: Business Development  
Time: Mar 2023 \- Present  
Tasks: Web3 and AI integrations, NFT/Lore/Coin curation  
My Experience: At LemonSocial, we offer content creators a platform to not only earn more from their content than others, but have a sense of security knowing that we are built with the creator in mind. Integrating AI and Crypto into the platform deeply, we aim to offer a lasting solution to content distribution for creators everywhere. I’ve personally created a full book dedicated to the Lore of this project, complete with an NFT collection, and 3 separate “expansion” collections \+ books.

### AI Layer Labs:

Role: Mod/Dev  
Time: Apr 2024 \- Present  
Tasks: Discord moderation, Bot Development  
My Experience: AI Layer Labs has created the “6079ai” protocol that is pioneering the “Proof-of-Inference” model. For this reason, we have amassed a large consortium of 25+ projects focused on accelerating Open-Sourced AI methodologies. We are building the largest and most advanced decentralized network of secure AI protocols. And I get to build some really cool bots using these tools :)

## Projects:

### Art3m1s

Content: D:\\Projects\\Art3m1s\\Images \- D:\\Projects\\Art3m1s\\The Ballad of Art3m1s.txt  
Status: Finished (Outdated)  
Goals: Create a fully interactive character utilizing the owned IP of an NFT from 0n1 Force (\#1870), complete with story, character arc, custom AI agent with text-to-speech and speech-to-text integrations.   
More info: I wanted to give my 0n1 life by writing a detailed story giving him deep backstory and lore. Basing this lore off the official 0n1 Force story, I was able to create my own example of what the 0n1 world would look like through my characters eyes, and give that character the powers of AI to give us a glimpse at that experience.

### AI Nicholas

Content: None  
Status: Unfinished  
Goals: Create an intelligent AI that is trained to act exactly like myself.  
More info: I mean who doesn’t want an AI version of themselves. Pssh.

### Cosmic Courier

Content: D:\\Projects\\Cosmic Courier  
Status: Ideation stage  
Goals: Create a unique endless runner with fun play-styles to release to various web3 projects.  
More info: I mainly wanted to see what my own skills would look like when applied to building a game. The idea seems easy enough to build an endless runner game with a deeper level of user engagement through custom branded IP, missions, and gaming league involvement.  
Link: None

### Snappy

Content: D:\\Projects\\Discord Bots\\SnappyV3.0  
Status: Finished Beta build  
Goals: A Discord bot with AI art generation and editing abilities.   
More info: Snappy started as a challenge to see if I could build a discord bot that utilized certain image generation tools. Once I figured that out I just kept adding tools and features. Snappy can generate an image from most OpenSource AI art models, it has tools to allow you to easily upscale, re-theme, remove background, replace images in objects, convert to video, and convert to gifs. All packaged into a pleasantly branded Discord bot experience.  
Link: D:\\Projects\\Discord Bots\\SnappyV3.0

### TraderWiz

Content:   
Status: Working  
Goals: Create an intuitive AI bot to analyze Stocks and Cryptocurrencies in multiple ways.  
More info: This was just a weekend project that turned out to be functional. I create an agent that analyzes different tickers and does research on companies to analyze their fundamental and technical data, track performance ratings, and give price predictions based on collected data.  
Link: D:\\Projects\\Discord Bots\\TraderWiz

### VolBot

Content: D:\\Projects\\Discord Bots\\VolBot  
Status: Working  
Goals: Create an easy to use interface to track the global marketcap volume in crypto on various time basis points.  
More info: I just really needed to track the marketcap info in a way that let me see real time changes easier. This script worked, so I packaged it into a discord bot with the intent of letting it run in its own channel for reference at any time.

### DreamWeaver

Content: None  
Status: unfinished Alpha stage  
Goals: A bedtime story generation app designed to give parents the ability to custom tailor their child's stories to familiar and specific requests.  
More info: This was one of the first ideas I had for building with AI, I wanted to build an agent that simply crafted stories for bedtime using keywords. I had about 60% of the code finished when the first app of its kind hit the market. I quickly moved on to another idea.   
Link: None

### FDA

Content: Restricted  
Status: Pending  
Goals: A customized AI assistant designed to optimize the workflow and experience for rideshare/delivery services.  
More info: I can’t say much about this until my team decides what we are doing with the idea. This could save rideshare workers a lot of time and teach them how to make more from the job they're already working.

### Project Cur8t0r

Content: None  
Status: Alpha  
Goals: A hyper-intelligent AI focused on guiding the curation of multi-layered storytelling experiences.  
More info: This is one of my ideas I smile about when I imagine it being a reality. The goal of the Cur8t0r is to provide users with the needed tools to design their own characters and stories, and then directly integrate them into existing stories and character use of others in a shared network of growing depth. With many many layers of cross-auditing for accuracy across stories and future ideation.

### RiffRipper

Content: D:\\Projects\\RiffRipper  
Status: Finished Beta Launched  
Goals: An easy to use tool to auto-extract zip files and place them in target directories.  
More info: This was the very first tool I built and publicly published. I was extracting 100+ zip files for CloneHero songs and realized that there had to be a faster way. So I started working on a script that would extract the files and put them in my /Songs folder for me. Then I decided the rest of the CloneHero community might also like this tool so I built a GUI for it, added multi-threading support, duplication checkers, and auto-delete and decided to take it public.

### SongSmith

Content: None  
Status: Not Started  
Goals: Enable users to upload music files to be processed into playable CloneHero songs.  
More info: This was a bit ambitious for the timing of when I came up with it. But the idea is to upload music of your choosing and allow the AI to process the song into a .midi format and produce accurate charts to play. Letting any song be turned into a gaming experience seamlessly.

Status: Unreleased  
Goals: Create an NFT collection complete with story, lore, marketing strategies, and scaling solutions.  
More info: This is one of my biggest projects to date, spanning 20,000+ images generated, 300+ different evolutions of story chapters, and many stressful nights thinking about the big picture of it all. This storytelling experience is rooted in the allure of mystery and ambition.

### Gaze

Content: D:\\AI Content Creation\\Art Project  
Status: Unreleased  
Goals: Push the boundaries of detail through AI art  
More info: I didn’t want to just create a bunch of images and slap the term “Art Project” on it. I wanted something deeper from this experience. I opted to instead create 10 different “Core” themes in this project. Each theme is generated in MANY different variations of styles, and each style has 2 copies of that scene. With 333 images created, the intended effect was to have the viewer simply want to stop and stare at the images intently focusing on the detailing that comes through in each of them. And thus the name, Gaze.

### Amber Inwood

Content: D:\\AI Content Creation\\AI Influencers\\Amber Inwood\\Images\\Training Data\\Raw \- Enhanced  
Status: Training  
Goals: Create a production ready AI influencer for various marketing and content generation needs.  
More info: This was my first attempt at creating my own AI influencer, having trained dozens of LoRa models and creating character consistency in other projects, I felt it beneficial to create my own blank character that could be used whenever needed. And yes her initials are AI…
